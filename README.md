## Akka Typed Java Cluster Sharding Example

This is an Akka Cluster project that includes an example use of
[Cluster Singleton](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster-singleton.html#cluster-singleton),
the [Receptionist](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actor-discovery.html#receptionist),
[Cluster Subscriptions](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster.html#cluster-subscriptions).
[Cluster Sharding](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster-sharding.html),
and cluster dashboard.

This project is one in a series of projects that starts with a simple Akka Cluster project and progressively builds up to examples of event sourcing and command query responsibility segregation - CQRS.

The project series is composed of the following GitHub repos:
* [akka-typed-java-cluster](https://github.com/mckeeh3/akka-typed-java-cluster)
* [akka-typed-java-cluster-sbr](https://github.com/mckeeh3/akka-typed-java-cluster-sbr)
* [akka-typed-java-cluster-aware](https://github.com/mckeeh3/akka-typed-java-cluster-aware)
* [akka-typed-java-cluster-singleton](https://github.com/mckeeh3/akka-typed-java-cluster-singleton)
* [akka-typed-java-cluster-sharding](https://github.com/mckeeh3/akka-typed-java-cluster-sharding)  (this project)
* [woe-sim](https://github.com/mckeeh3/woe-sim)
* [woe-twin](https://github.com/mckeeh3/woe-twin)

Each project can be cloned, built, and runs independently of the other projects.
